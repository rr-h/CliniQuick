Let's expand the application, such that the notes are stored to the backend. We'll use [json-server](/en/part2/getting_data_from_server), familiar from part 2.


The initial state of the database is stored into the file <i>db.json</i>, which is placed in the root of the project:

```json
{
  "notes": [
    {
      "content": "the app state is in redux store",
      "important": true,
      "id": 1
    },
    {
      "content": "state changes are made with actions",
      "important": false,
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}
```



We'll install json-server for the project...

```js
npm install json-server --save
```



and add the following line to the <i>scripts</i> part of the file <i>package.json</i>

```js
"scripts": {
  "server": "json-server -p3001 db.json",
  // ...
}
```



Now let's launch json-server with the command _npm run server_.



Next we'll create a method into the file <i>services/notes.js</i>, which uses <i>axios</i> to fetch data from the backend

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/notes'

const getAll = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(baseUrl)
  return response.data
}

export default { getAll }
```



We'll add axios to the project

```js
npm install axios --save
```



We'll change the initialization of the state in <i>noteReducer</i>, such that by default there are no notes:

```js
const noteReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  // ...
};
```



A quick way to initialize the state based on the data on the server is to fetch the notes in the file <i>index.js</i> and dispatch the action <i>NEW\_NOTE</i> for each of them:

```js
// ...
import noteService from './services/notes' // highlight-line

const reducer = combineReducers({
  notes: noteReducer,
  filter: filterReducer,
});

const store = createStore(reducer);

// highlight-start
noteService.getAll().then(notes =>
  notes.forEach(note => {
    store.dispatch({ type: 'NEW_NOTE', data: note })
  })
)
// highlight-end

// ...
```



Let's add support in the reducer for the action <i>INIT\_NOTES</i>, using which the initialization can be done by dispatching a single action. Let's also create an action creator function _initializeNotes_.

```js
// ...
const noteReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  console.log('ACTION:', action)
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'NEW_NOTE':
      return [...state, action.data]
    case 'INIT_NOTES':   // highlight-line
      return action.data // highlight-line
    // ...
  }
}

export const initializeNotes = (notes) => {
  return {
    type: 'INIT_NOTES',
    data: notes,
  }
}

// ...
```


<i>index.js</i> simplifies:

```js
import noteReducer, { initializeNotes } from './reducers/noteReducer'
// ...

noteService.getAll().then(notes =>
  store.dispatch(initializeNotes(notes))
)
```


> **NB:** why didn't we use await in place of promises and event handlers (registered to _then_-methods)?
>

> Await only works inside <i>async</i> functions, and the code in <i>index.js</i> is not inside a function, so due to the simple nature of the operation, we'll abstain from using <i>async</i> this time.



We do, however, decide to move the initialization of the notes into the <i>App</i> component, and, as usual when fetching data from a server, we'll use the <i>effect hook</i>. 



To get the action creator <i>initializeNotes</i> into use in the component <i>App</i> we will once again need the help of the _connect_-method:

```js
import React, { useEffect } from 'react' // highlight-line
import { connect } from 'react-redux'  // highlight-line
import NewNote from './components/NewNote'
import Notes from './components/Notes'
import VisibilityFilter from './components/VisibilityFilter'
import noteService from './services/notes' // highlight-line
import { initializeNotes } from './reducers/noteReducer' // highlight-line

const App = (props) => {
// highlight-start
  useEffect(() => {
    noteService
      .getAll().then(notes => props.initializeNotes(notes))
  },[])
// highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <NewNote />
      <VisibilityFilter />
      <Notes />
    </div>
  )
}

export default connect(null, { initializeNotes })(App) // highlight-line
```

This way the function <i>initializeNotes</i> becomes a prop, in the form of <i>props.initializeNotes</i>, for the component <i>App</i>, and when calling it we won't need the _dispatch_-method, because _connect_ handles this for us.



We can do the same thing when it comes to creating a new note. Let's expand the code communicating with the server as follows:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const baseUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/notes'

const getAll = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(baseUrl)
  return response.data
}
// highlight-start
const createNew = async content => {
  const object = { content, important: false }
  const response = await axios.post(baseUrl, object)
  return response.data
}
// highlight-end

export default {
  getAll,
  createNew, // highlight-line
}
```



The method _addNote_ of the component <i>NoteForm</i> changes slightly:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { connect } from 'react-redux'
import { createNote } from '../reducers/noteReducer'
import noteService from '../services/notes'  // highlight-line

const NewNote = (props) => {
  const addNote = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const content = event.target.note.value
    event.target.note.value = ''
    const newNote = await noteService.createNew(content) // highlight-line
    props.createNote(newNote) // highlight-line
  }

  return (
    // ...
  )
}

export default connect(null, { createNote } )(NewNote)
```



Because the backend generates ids for the notes, we'll change the action creator _createNote_

```js
export const createNote = (data) => {
  return {
    type: 'NEW_NOTE',
    data,
  }
}
```



Changing the importance of notes could be implemented using the same principle, meaning making an asynchronous method call to the server and then dispatching an appropriate action.



The current state of the code for the application can be found on [github](https://github.com/fullstackopen-2019/redux-notes/tree/part6-5) in the branch <i>part6-5</i>.

### Exercises


#### 6.16 Anecdotes and the backend, step1


When the application launches, fetch the anecdotes from the backend implemented using json-server.



As the initial backend data, you can use, e.g. [this](https://github.com/fullstackopen-2019/misc/blob/master/anecdotes.json).


#### 6.17 Anecdotes and the backend, step2



Modify the creation of new anecdotes, such that the anecdotes are stored in the backend.

### Asynchronous actions and redux thunk



Our approach is OK, but it is not great that the communication with the server happens inside the functions of the components. It would be better if the communication could be abstracted away from the components, such that they don't have to do anything else but call the appropriate <i>action creator</i>. As an example, <i>App</i> would initialize the state of the application as follows:

```js
const App = (props) => {

  useEffect(() => {
    props.initializeNotes(notes)
  },[])
  // ...
}
```



and <i>NoteForm</i> would create a new note as follows:

```js
const NewNote = (props) => {
  const addNote = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const content = event.target.note.value
    event.target.note.value = ''
    props.createNote(content)
  }
```



Both components would only use the function provided to them as a prop without caring about the communication with the server that is happening in the background.



Now let's install the [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)-library, which enables us to create <i>asynchronous actions</i>. Installation is done with the command:

```js
npm install --save redux-thunk
```



The redux-thunk-library is a so-called <i>redux-middleware</i>, which must be initialized along with the initialization of the store. While we're here, let's extract the definition of the store into its own file <i>src/store.js</i>:

```js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

import noteReducer from './reducers/noteReducer'
import filterReducer from './reducers/filterReducer'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  notes: noteReducer,
  filter: filterReducer,
})

const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunk))

export default store
```



After the changes the file <i>src/index.js</i> looks like this

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import App from './App'
import store from './store'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
document.getElementById('root'))
```



Thanks to redux-thunk, it is possible to define <i>action creators</i> so that they return a function having the <i>dispatch</i>-method of redux-store as its parameter. As a result of this, one can make asynchronous action creators, which first wait for some operation to finish, after which they then dispatch the real action.



Now we can define the action creator, <i>initializeNotes</i>, that initializes the state of the notes as follows:

```js
export const initializeNotes = () => {
  return async dispatch => {
    const notes = await noteService.getAll()
    dispatch({
      type: 'INIT_NOTES',
      data: notes,
    })
  }
}
```



In the inner function, meaning the <i>asynchronous action</i>, the operation first fetches all the notes from the server and then <i>dispatches</i> the notes to the action, which adds them to the store.



The component <i>App</i> can now be defined as follows:

```js
const App = (props) => {

  useEffect(() => {
    props.initializeNotes()
  },[])

  return (
    <div>
      <NewNote />
      <VisibilityFilter />
      <Notes />
    </div>
  )
}

export default connect(
  null, { initializeNotes }
)(App)
```



The solution is elegant. The initialization logic for the notes has been completely separated to outside the React component.



The action creator _createNew_, which adds a new note looks like this

```js
export const createNote = content => {
  return async dispatch => {
    const newNote = await noteService.createNew(content)
    dispatch({
      type: 'NEW_NOTE',
      data: newNote,
    })
  }
}
```



The principle here is the same: first an asynchronous operation is executed, after which the action changing the state of the store is <i>dispatched</i>.



The component <i>NewNote</i> changes as follows:

```js
const NewNote = (props) => {
  const addNote = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault()
    const content = event.target.note.value
    event.target.note.value = ''
    props.createNote(content)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={addNote}>
      <input name="note" />
      <button type="submit">add</button>
    </form>
  )
}

export default connect(
  null, { createNote }
)(NewNote)
```



The current state of the code for the application can be found on [github](https://github.com/fullstackopen-2019/redux-notes/tree/part6-6) in the branch <i>part6-6</i>.


### Redux DevTools



There is an extension [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) that can be installed on Chrome, in which the state of the Redux-store and the action that changes it can be monitored from the console of the browser.



When debugging, in addition to the browser extension we also have the software library [redux-devtools-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-devtools-extension). Let's install it using the command:

```js
npm install --save redux-devtools-extension
```



We'll have to slightly change the definition of the store to get the library up and running:

```js
// ...
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
import thunk from 'redux-thunk'
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension' // highlight-line

import noteReducer from './reducers/noteReducer'
import filterReducer from './reducers/filterReducer'

const reducer = combineReducers({
  notes: noteReducer,
  filter: filterReducer
})

const store = createStore(
  reducer,
  // highlight-start
  composeWithDevTools(
    applyMiddleware(thunk)
  )
  // highlight-end
)

export default store
```

Now when you open the console, the <i>redux</i> tab looks like this:

![](../../images/6/11e.png)

It's also possible to dispatch actions to the store using the console

![](../../images/6/12e.png)

### Redux and component state

We have come a long way in this course and, finally, we have come to the point at which we are using React "the right way", meaning React only focuses on generating the views, and the application state is separated completely from the React components and passed on to Redux, its actions, and its reducers.

What about the _useState_-hook, which provides components with their own state? Does it have any role if an application is using Redux or some other external state management solution? If the application has more complicated forms, it may be beneficial to implement their local state using the state provided by the _useState_ function. One can, of course, have Redux manage the state of the forms, however, if the state of the form is only relevant when filling the form (e.g. for validation) it may be wise to leave the management of state to the component responsible for the form.

The final version of the code for the application can be found on [github](https://github.com/fullstackopen-2019/redux-notes/tree/part6-7) in the branch <i>part6-7</i>.

### Exercises


#### 6.18 Anecdotes and the backend, step3



Modify the initialization of redux-store to happen using asynchronous action creators, which are made possible by the <i>redux-thunk</i>-library.


#### 6.19 Anecdotes and the backend, step4



Also modify the creation of a new anecdote to happen using asynchronous action creators, made possible by the <i>redux-thunk</i>-library.


#### 6.20 Anecdotes and the backend, step5



Voting does not yet save changes to the backend. Fix the situation with the help of the <i>redux-thunk</i>-library.


#### 6.21 Anecdotes and the backend, step6



The creation of notifications is still a bit tedious, since one has to do two actions and use the _setTimeout_ function:

```js
props.setNotification(`you voted '${anecdote.content}'`)
setTimeout(() => {
  props.clearNotification()
}, 5000)
```



Make an asynchronous action creator, which enables one to provide the notification as follows:

```js
props.setNotification(`you voted '${anecdote.content}'`, 10)
```



the first parameter is the text to be rendered and the second parameter is the time to display the notification given in seconds. 



Implement the use of this improved notification in your application.

This was the last exercise for this part of the course and it's time to push your code to GitHub and mark all of your finished exercises to the [exercise submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/fullstackopen2019).
