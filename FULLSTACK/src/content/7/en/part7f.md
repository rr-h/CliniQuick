In addition to the three exercises in the [React router](/en/part7/react_router) section of this seventh part of the course material, there are 17 exercises that continue our work on the Bloglist application that we worked on in parts four and five of the course material. Some of the following exercises are "features" that are independent of one another, meaning that there is no need to finish the exercises in any particular order. You are free to skip over a part of the exercises if you wish to do so.


If you do not want to use your own Bloglist application, you are free to use the code from the model solution as a starting point for these exercises. 


Many of the exercises in this part of the course material will require the refactoring of existing code. This is a common reality of extending existing applications, meaning that refactoring is an important and necessary skill even if it may feel difficult and unpleasant at times.


One good piece of advice for both refactoring and writing new code is to take <i> baby steps</i>. Losing your sanity is almost guaranteed if you leave the application in a completely broken state for long periods of time while refactoring.

### Exercises

#### 7.4: redux, step1


Refactor the application from using internal React component state to using Redux for the application's state management.


Additionally, change the application's notifications to use Redux at this point of the exercise set.

#### 7.5 redux, step2


Store the information about blog posts in the Redux store.


You are free to manage the state for logging in and creating new blog posts by using the internal state of React components.


This and the next exercise are quite laborious but incredibly educational.

#### 7.6 redux, step3


Store the information about the signed in user in the Redux store.


#### 7.7 Users view


Implement a view to the application that displays all of the basic information related to users:

#### 7.8 Individual user view


Implement a view for individual users, that displays all of the blog posts added by that user:

![](../../images/7/44.png)


You can access the view by clicking the name of the user in the view that lists all users:

![](../../images/7/43.png)


<i>**NB1:**</i> if your application uses Redux for state management, it may be beneficial to use the second [ownProps](https://react-redux.js.org/api/connect#mapstatetoprops-state-ownprops-object) parameter of _mapStateToProps_. It is quite [simple to use](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41198842/what-is-the-use-of-the-ownprops-arg-in-mapstatetoprops-and-mapdispatchtoprops) despite the slightly obscure documentation.


<i>**NB2:**</i> you will almost certainly stumble across the following error message during this exercise:

![](../../images/7/42a.png)


The error message will occur if you refresh the page for an individual user.


The cause of the issue is that when we navigate directly to the page of an individual user, the React application has not yet received the data from the backend. One solution for fixing the problem is to use conditional rendering:

```js
const User = (props) => {
  // highlight-start
  if ( props.user === undefined) { 
    return null
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.user.name}</h2>

      <h3>added blogs</h3>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
```


#### 7.9 Blog view


Implement a separate view for blog posts. You can model the layout of your view after the following example:
.
![](../../images/7/45.png)


Users should be able to access the view by clicking the name of the blog post in the view that lists of all of the blog posts.

![](../../images/7/46.png)


After you're done with this exercise, the functionality that was implemented in exercise 5.6 is no longer necessary. Clicking a blog post no longer needs to expand the item in the list and display the details of the blog post.


#### 7.10 Navigation


Implement a navigation menu for the application:

![](../../images/7/47.png)


#### 7.11 comments, step1


Implement the functionality for commenting on blog posts:

![](../../images/7/48.png)


Comments should be anonymous, meaning that they are not associated to the user who left the comment.


In this exercise it is enough for the frontend to only display the comments that the application receives from the backend.


An appropriate mechanism for adding comments to a blog post would be an HTTP POST request to the <i>api/blogs/:id/comments</i> endpoint.


#### 7.12 comments, step2


Extend your application so that users can add comments to blog posts from the frontend:

#### 7.13 Styles, step1


Improve the appearance of your application by applying one of the methods shown in the course material.


#### 7.14 Styles, step2


You can mark this exercise as finished if you use an hour or more for styling your application.


#### 7.15 ESLint


Configure the frontend of your application to use ESLint


#### 7.16 


Implement a suitable webpack configuration for your application from scratch.


#### 7.17 End to end testing, step1


Implement at least two end to end tests for your application with the [Cypress](/en/part7/class_components_e_2_e_testing#end-to-end-testing-of-the-application) library. One suitable use case for testing would be logging in to the application with an existing user.


You can assume that the state of the database is suitable for your tests in this exercise. In the example use case described above, you would assume that your application already has one registered user.


It is recommended to spend some time reading through the documentation for Cypress. The [best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html) page in particular contains a lot of valuable tips that are good to keep in mind when writing your tests.


#### 7.18 End to end testing, step2


Expand your E2E tests so that the tests [initialize the state of the database](/en/part7/class_components_e_2_e_testing#controlling-the-state-of-the-database) always before the tests are executed. Write at least one test that modifies the application's database e.g. by creating a new blog post.


#### 7.19 End to end testing, step3


Expand the coverage of your E2E tests. You can mark this exercise as finished if you have used at least 30 minutes on this exercise.


#### 7.20 Course feedback


How did we do? Give us some feedback for the course in Moodle!

This was the last exercise for this part of the course and it's time to push your code to GitHub and mark all of your finished exercises to the [exercise submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/fullstackopen2019).
